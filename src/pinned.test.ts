/**
 * A proof a stranger cannot check is not a proof. Two rules, from the kaspanet/kccs#29 review and
 * from what it turned into on 2026-09-22: no truncated ids, and every cited id archived.
 *
 * The second bit here. The README's six claim ids were whole and correct, and every one of them
 * had aged out of the public index -- which serves about six days -- so "anyone can check this"
 * had quietly stopped being true. They were re-run and archived on 2026-09-22.
